# How to Customize the Appearance of CardViewItems in WPF CardView Control

The [WPF CardView](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/card-view/getting-started) control is a flexible and visually appealing panel that organizes a collection of items into card layouts. It is designed to provide a modern way of displaying data with support for advanced features such as **grouping**, **sorting**, **filtering**, and **editing**. Additionally, the control can display grouped items in a hierarchical tree structure, making it ideal for scenarios where structured data visualization is required.

By default, the CardView displays items in a **rectangular shape**, but developers often need to customize the appearance to match application themes or improve user experience. This sample demonstrates how to modify the **CardViewItem template** to achieve a personalized look and feel. You can change shapes, apply custom styles, and even include additional UI elements within each card to create a unique design.

### Why Customize CardViewItems?

- Align the card design with your application’s branding.
- Improve readability and usability for end-users.
- Add interactive elements or custom visuals inside cards.

Customization is achieved by editing the **DataTemplate** or **ControlTemplate** of the CardViewItem. This allows developers to replace the default rectangular layout with custom shapes such as rounded corners, borders, or even completely different designs.
